The**ESC**\(Electronic Speed Controller\) allows the speed control of the motors according to the orders of the flight controller. Typically the control signal used by the ESCs is a PWM \(Pulse Width Modulation\) but some models allow the use of**I2C**or**CAN**signals.

The Pixhawk 3 Pro has**8 PWM outputs**for 8 ESC / Motor pairs.

  


### HARDWARE

Please connect each of your PWM ESCs to the corresponding "**Main Out**" output. Refer to the diagram below for the order of your ESC / Motor.

All blue motors should only be used with CCW propellers. Green motors with CW propellers.

To see what a CCW propeller looks like, please see the previous picture.

Alsocheck the direction of the motors.**For safety reasons, remove the propellers before handling !!!!!!**

To reverse the direction of a motor it is enough to reverse 2 of the 3 cables that go from the engine to the ESC.
