# Airspeed

![qgroundcontrol](../../images/pitot.jpg)


**Plane** supports the use of an airspeed sensor, which can help in windy condition, slow flight and autonomous landings. It is not recommended for most new users, however, as it does require additional tuning and adds one more layer of control to set up.

The digital differential airspeed sensor has a very low offset, a high resolution and, best of all, does not suffer from the noise induced by long cables.
