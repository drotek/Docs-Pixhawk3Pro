**GPS **is a device that is commonly used on a drone or robot. It makes it possible **geolocate **the position of the system and thus to be located in space.

GPS is essential when moving **autonomously**.

In the case of the drone, it will make it possible to fix the position of the system in the air and allow the operator to carry out other tasks during this time.
