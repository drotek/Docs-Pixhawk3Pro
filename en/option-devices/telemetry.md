**Telemetry** keeps a wireless connection between the **Pixhawk** and the **ground station**.

On the latter, you can receive in real time all the data of the drone such as the position GPS, the speed, the current consumptions, the altitude, ... as well as to send commands to the drone from the ground station.

There are several telemetry technologies such as **Bluetooth, WIFI, XBee, RF** 433 / 915MHz systems.
